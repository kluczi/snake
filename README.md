# Snake Game

## Description

A modern reinterpretation of the classic “Snake” game, written in C++ using SDL2. Unlike traditional implementations, colliding with walls does not end the game — instead, play continues and special bonuses appear that either shorten the snake or reduce its speed. Navigate the snake to consume food, manage your length, and strategically use bonuses to maximize your score.
